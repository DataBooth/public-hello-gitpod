# Download & install dependencies, run build scripts, you name it - tasks Gitpod takes care of before you start a new development environment 
# so you donâ€™t have to wait for any of that. With prebuilds enabled for your project, Gitpod runs the before, init and prebuild commands 
# in your `.gitpod.yml` file every time code is pushed to your repository. The resulting snapshot of the development environment is called a prebuilt workspace.
# When anyone starts a new workspace, all Gitpod needs to do is load the prebuilt workspace. 
# Since the heavy-lifting happened during the prebuild phase, the workspace starts up quickly, allowing you to start your work right away.

## Currently 'dbooth' chooses to be a python 3.8 environment

# NOTE: Plan for now is just to work in the conda base environment - could use a one or two other
#       conda envs if warranted -- this disposable Gitpod.io infrastructure sort of takes care
#       of not getting too distracted with Docker / virtualenvs / conda envs.
