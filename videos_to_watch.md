# Summary of Introductory Training Videos

All of these videos are short and sharpish, Depending on your previous experience, choose the ones that are most helpful to get you up to speed.

Keep a list of questions and please ask for clarification on anything that doesn't make sense. We suggest using the Slack `#interns` channel as others
probably have the same question(s).

The tech-stack that we have chosen is quite intentional and based on (a lot of) research. However the world, particularly in our space, changes quickly so we are always happy to hear about other alternatives. At this point in time you'll need to learn the following (although our choices are informed by what are re-usable skills to take away).

## Gitpod.io

Gitpod is the (browser-delivered) platform that we use for our development work. It allows us to define our (disposable) environments in code and have a known starting point and the freedom to experiment without "fear", which is essential for learning to code and writing good quality, reproducible code.

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code is a (free) integrated development environment (IDE) provided by Microsoft. Ultimately it is a text editor with lots of cool (community-contributed) extensions for being more productive and reducing errors. If you like using Vim, Emacs, Atom, JetBrains, nano etc and think you'll be more productive with one of these then let's have a chat.

There are lots of videos on various aspects of VS Code.

Also there are some tutorials on Python and Data Science within VS Code. Some of this information may be out of date as there is a lot of active development in this part of the ecosystem currently.

Please note that Jupyter notebooks can now be run/edited from within the VS Code environment.

## Python

### Conda

We use `conda` as a cross-platform package manager.

### JupyterLab and Jupyter notebook

There is lots of information here -
